## Visual-SortScape
A Sorting Visualizer is a software tool that visually demonstrates and animates the step-by-step operation of various sorting algorithms, providing an intuitive and educational way to understand their functionality.

The Sorting Algorithm included in our program is 
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort

While executing the program, the point to be remembered is NOT to give repetitive commands as it may slow down the execution. So give new command only after the execution of  current one is finished.


The Output of the Program:
